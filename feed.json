            "content": "\n<p>Our founder Justin Mast has been waiting for quite some time to bring Outdoor Porch + Patio to life. With our new collection, any indoor plant caretaker can now take that next step as a gardener and venture into outdoor plant care and gardening. In fact, it’s been Justin’s dream ever since he was an eight-year-old kid selling plants outside of his parents’ greenhouse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re excited to finally offer a curated selection of young annuals and foliage, plus all the tools, supplies, and Grow-How™ you’ll need to feel like a master gardener by the end of the summer. Watch the video below to learn more about why Bloomscape launched our latest collection for outdoor gardening.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure><div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://bloomscape.com/shop/plants/outdoor-porch-patio-plants/bloom-kits/\">Shop Outdoor Porch + Patio</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h4>Video Transcript</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><em>So I am very excited to be launching into outdoor plants. This is a moment that I’ve been waiting for, for a long time and that our customers have been asking for as well. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This is a chance to really extend the experience you’ve had with indoor gardening outside of your home and to really grow as a gardener.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We crafted this program to make sure you can really experience the thrill of gardening.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When you open your kit, it’s going to be pure potential. Young plants that are ready to be planted and really grow and thrive in your environment over the course of the season</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>So I come from a long line of greenhouse owners and operators. It goes back five generations on my dad’s side and three generations on my mom’s side, of pioneers in the floral industry. So we come from, really the Dutch heritage of horticulture and greenhouse technology. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seeing how much people love to buy plants directly from the greenhouse — I think the plants were bigger, better healthier — so, there’s some DNA there that’s now landing in Bloomscape and allows us to bring a lot of the value that we bring to our customers. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Outdoor gardening is special because it’s a way to connect to the seasons. It’s a way to celebrate the coming of spring and to really be outside and enjoy the summer.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>One of the other really great things about this program is that each container will have a combination of plants that share the same pot. This is going to be really exciting because the different plants will grow together and they’ll really change together over the course of the season. You’ll see different plants go in and out of bloom, and each container garden will be dynamic over the course of the summer. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And so we’ve done a lot of the work, testing 1000s of different combinations of plants and different lighting conditions, and different wind conditions to make sure that we’ve really selected and curated the best combinations of plants to choose from. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And just like everything we do at Bloomscape, we’ll be here to answer your questions, we’ll have great content online, and the app will be an awesome tool for helping you be really successful. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We’ve really designed this program to make sure that you feel like a master gardener by the end of the summer. I’m thrilled and honored that we can help so many people take that next step into gardening.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bloomscape.com/porch-patio-plant-care/why-outdoor-gardening/\">Why Outdoor Porch + Patio Gardening: A Note from Our Founder</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bloomscape.com/\">Bloomscape</a>.</p>\n",

If you’re new to outdoor gardening, don’t worry — Bloomscape’s Plant Mom has put together a how-to guide for potting new annuals in their planters. Start your porch and patio garden with Grow-How™ and follow along with Joyce Mast in the tutorial below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>My Bloom Kits Are Here…Now What?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As soon as your Bloom Kits are delivered, we recommend unboxing your young plants to provide them with a thorough watering. Your plants will likely be thirsty from their trip, so water according to the instructions provided with your Bloom Kits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plan to plant your Bloom Kits in their planters within seven days using <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/product/potting-soil/\">potting soil</a> and the fertilizer packets included with your plants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Plant Your Bloom Kit With Plant Mom</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the video below, watch Bloomscape’s Plant Mom Joyce walk you through the Bloom Kit planting process.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure><h3>Step 1: Prepare Pot for Planting</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Get ready for planting by adding <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/product/potting-soil/\">potting soil</a> to your planter. Add the slow-release fertilizer to the soil according to the instructions included with your Bloom Kit. Mix evenly into the soil so that it’s well distributed throughout the potting mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 2: Plant Your Young Plants</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Add the Bloom Kit to the soil by creating a small hole for the plant pod using your fingers. Be careful not to pack down the soil too tightly — you’ll want your soil light and airy for the best results.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 3: Follow Your Planting Arrangement</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Each Bloom Kit includes a ‘plantagram,’ which is the diagram for how to arrange the plants within a pot. Plant Mom has created unique planting arrangements for each Bloom Kit box, or you can create your own style to display your plants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 4: Water Your Bloom Kit</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Water your young plants thoroughly once planted. Be sure to provide your plants with enough water so that water drains out from the drainage hole in your pot. This will ensure your Bloom Kit has what it needs to begin growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Need More Help?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Plant Mom and the Grow-How™ Team are here to help you throughout your outdoor plant care journey.

Your home’s mix of sun and shade will then determine which outdoor plants you should include in your garden. At Bloomscape, we define “full sun” as an area that gets six-plus hours of direct sunlight, and “full shade” as an area that gets six-plus hours of direct shade (like a covered porch, patio, or balcony).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 2: Shop <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/shop/plants/outdoor-porch-patio-plants/bloom-kits/\">Bloom Kits</a> based on your garden’s needs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure you get the right plants delivered at the right time, our <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/shop/plants/outdoor-porch-patio-plants/bloom-kits/\">Bloom Kits</a> are organized by lighting and size. With over 20 Bloom Kit offerings, our collection of single and multi-variety kits vary in color and are suited for full sun or full shade, plus a few species that can thrive in either sun or shade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Standard Combination Kit features a vibrant mix of eight plants of three different varieties, while our Deluxe Combination Kit features 16 plants of three varieties. In addition to the dynamic Combination Bloom Kits, we also offer nine Accent Bloom Kits, each featuring six plants of a single variety that’ll add a splash of color to your garden or complement a larger arrangement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, many of our Bloom Kits include pollinating flowers that may attract butterflies, bees, and even hummingbirds!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To best protect the health of your Bloom Kits once planted, your kits will be shipped out according to your region’s hardiness zone, which is determined by your zip code. This will ensure that the risk of frost has passed in your area before your Bloom Kits even reach your door.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 3: Buy your <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/shop/plants/outdoor-porch-patio-plants/tools-supplies/\">gardening supplies</a>\n</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To make outdoor gardening easy, our new collection provides you with expert recommendations from Bloomscape’s own Plant Mom to grow and care for your Bloom Kits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From our signature <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/product/potting-soil/\">Garden Soil</a>, <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/product/garden-gloves/\">Garden Gloves</a>, and <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/product/haws-watering-can/\">Haws Outdoor Watering Can</a> to top-of-the-line gardening essentials like all-purpose fertilizer from heritage brand Jack’s Fertilizer, you’ll have everything your plants need to thrive. Our outdoor pots and planters also have proper drainage to ensure that your plants don’t suffer from too much moisture, which can lead to root rot.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2560x1780_210218_bloom-kit-lifestyle_back-door-crop-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-418349\" srcset=\"https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2560x1780_210218_bloom-kit-lifestyle_back-door-crop-1024x683.jpg?ver=418349 1024w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2560x1780_210218_bloom-kit-lifestyle_back-door-crop-300x200.jpg?ver=418349 300w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2560x1780_210218_bloom-kit-lifestyle_back-door-crop-768x512.jpg?ver=418349 768w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2560x1780_210218_bloom-kit-lifestyle_back-door-crop-1536x1025.jpg?ver=418349 1536w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2560x1780_210218_bloom-kit-lifestyle_back-door-crop-2048x1366.jpg?ver=418349 2048w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2560x1780_210218_bloom-kit-lifestyle_back-door-crop-324x216.jpg?ver=418349 324w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure><h2>Step 4: Plan your garden design and potting arrangements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every gardener knows the importance of planning your design ahead of time. Fortunately, the plant care experts on our Grow-How™ Team created our Bloom Kits with plants that are proven to grow together harmoniously rather than overgrowing and crowding out the rest of the arrangement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most importantly, each Bloom Kit features a hand-selected mix of annual flowers and foliage varieties in complementary plant heights, widths, and colors to help you achieve classic outdoor container gardens. To help with designing your Bloom Kit, Plant Mom has created unique planting arrangements for each kit known as a ‘plantagram.’ You can always design your own style to display your flowers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 5: Roll up your sleeves and start planting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the danger of frost has passed in your hardiness zone and your Bloom Kits and gardening tools arrive, now it’s time to plant! We recommend unboxing your kits as soon as they’re delivered to provide them with a thorough watering — your plants will likely be thirsty from their trip so water according to the instructions provided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plan to plant your Bloom Kits in their planters within seven days using Potting Soil and the fertilizer packets included with your plants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a closer look at <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/how-to-plant-bloom-kits/\">how to plant your Bloom Kits</a>, watch Bloomscape’s Plant Mom walk you through the planting process in the video below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure><p>For more outdoor gardening inspiration, visit our <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/category/porch-patio-plant-care/\">Porch + Patio Plant Care blog</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bloomscape.com/porch-patio-plant-care/5-steps-to-start-outdoor-container-garden/\">How to Start Your Own Outdoor Garden in 5 Easy Steps</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bloomscape.com/\">Bloomscape</a>.</p>\n",

While the manual labor is over, the work of caring for your outdoor annuals has just begun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, tending to your plants’ needs is an important — and not to mention rewarding — part of outdoor gardening. To ensure that you provide the best care for your new blooms, we’ve compiled a set of tips for outdoor container gardening, courtesy of Plant Mom and the Grow-How™ Team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this guide, you’ll find basic care information for outdoor porch and patio gardens to help your blooms thrive, from planting and sunlight to watering and fertilization.

Planting Your Bloom Kits</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your Bloom Kits arrive, it’s time to start your garden! We recommend unboxing and planting as soon as possible. Your new plant pods are most likely thirsty after their trip, so it’s important to thoroughly water them according to the instructions included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, remove each pod from their paper sleeve, and place the plants in a dish with half an inch of standing water until each soil ball is damp, which should take about 10–15 minutes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, pot your Bloom Kits in your planters with potting soil according to the planting diagram included in the Bloom Kit box, or come up with your own unique design! Learn how to plant your Bloom Kits with help from Bloomscape’s own Plant Mom.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure><p>Once your entire kit is planted, give each pot a deep watering so water runs out the pot’s drainage hole to help the flowers and foliage root.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Determining Lighting &amp; Placement</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Bloom Kits are recommended for two lighting conditions: full sun or full shade. Plants that thrive in full sun can tolerate six-plus hours of full sun, while plants that do well in full shade prefer six-plus hours of shade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plant Mom and the Grow-How™ encourage you to choose plants based on the outdoor lighting unique to your home, whether you have a sunny garden, a shaded porch, or a partially covered patio. This will make sure your plants stay healthy for the entire growing season!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to following instructions for lighting, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on your plants for signs of distress. <a href=\"https://hotgardens.net/\">If you live in a dry, hot area like Arizona</a>, for example, you may need to move your pots to a shady spot during peak sunlight hours to avoid dry, burnt leaves. Conversely, <a href=\"https://davesgarden.com/guides/articles/plants-that-thrive-in-wet-climates\">if you live in a rainy or more tropical area</a>, make sure your pots get a chance to dry out to avoid root rot or fungal infections.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2560x1780_210218_bloom-kit-lifestyle_woman-hose-closeup-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-416777\" srcset=\"https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2560x1780_210218_bloom-kit-lifestyle_woman-hose-closeup-1024x683.jpg?ver=416777 1024w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2560x1780_210218_bloom-kit-lifestyle_woman-hose-closeup-300x200.jpg?ver=416777 300w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2560x1780_210218_bloom-kit-lifestyle_woman-hose-closeup-768x512.jpg?ver=416777 768w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2560x1780_210218_bloom-kit-lifestyle_woman-hose-closeup-1536x1024.jpg?ver=416777 1536w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2560x1780_210218_bloom-kit-lifestyle_woman-hose-closeup-2048x1365.jpg?ver=416777 2048w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2560x1780_210218_bloom-kit-lifestyle_woman-hose-closeup-324x216.jpg?ver=416777 324w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure><h2>3. Watering Your Outdoor Plants</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, watering instructions are unique to each plant and highly dependent on the light conditions, temperatures, and precipitation in your area. Some plants require frequent watering while others can suffer from overwatering, but generally speaking, water your plants thoroughly when the top 25 percent of the soil feels dry to the touch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to avoid splashing water on the foliage and blooms as the additional moisture can lead to diseases and garden pests.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Fertilizing Your Annuals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fertilizer is essentially a superfood for plants that can help them grow vibrant, eye-catching blossoms and foliage all season long. While fertilization is ultimately up to you, we recommend mixing the included slow-release fertilizer into the soil before planting to ensure healthy, strong plants, and supplement with a liquid water-soluble fertilizer once a month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you decide against the slow-release fertilizer, be sure to supplement with a liquid water-soluble fertilizer every other watering.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Deadheading Your Bloom Kits</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While deadheading is somewhat optional for houseplants, it’s a much more important practice when tending to outdoor gardens. Annuals in particular will bloom for much longer if you regularly pinch back the flowers as it lengthens the plant’s growth cycle and encourages new growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To deadhead, inspect your flower pots or beds for wilting and/or browning flowers. Using a sharp, clean pruner, cut off the flower stem below the dying bloom and discard. Wipe the blade clean after each cut to mitigate the spread of infections and diseases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have the basics down for outdoor container gardening, you are ready for spring.

            "content": "\n<p>As you’re planning your outdoor garden, you’ll often come across the terms ‘annuals’ and ‘perennials,’ but what’s the difference? As the foundation of colorful outdoor gardens, annual and perennial flowering plants are often commonly mistaken for one another.  Because their blooms and foliage can look similar, this can certainly lead to confusion and frustration if you aren’t familiar with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing the benefits and drawbacks of annuals and perennials can help you determine your outdoor plant needs so that you can effectively plan and grow a beautiful, timeless garden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Bloomscape we aim to provide all gardeners — from the novices to the experts to everyone in between — with the information they need to grow healthy, thriving yards. Keep reading to learn more about the basics of annuals and perennials, plus care tips, popular species, and the pros and cons of each plant type.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s the Difference Between Annuals and Perennials?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The terms ‘annual’ and ‘perennial’ refer to <a href=\"https://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/wildseed/growing/annual.html\">the plant’s life span</a>, or the amount of time it takes a plant to grow from seeds to eventually produce seeds of its own. Annual flowers root, bloom, produce seeds, and die all within the same growing season, which typically spans spring through fall. Perennials, on the other hand, regrow every spring for between two and five years (or longer) and produce flowers for much shorter blooming periods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While herbaceous perennial flowers typically die come winter similar to annuals, perennials will sprout year after year again in the early spring from the same root system. With the exception of a few self-sowing varieties that drop their seeds, annuals generally will not regrow the next season unless you collect their seeds at the end of the season and replant them the following spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though annuals die off at the end of the season, their blooming season often lasts for multiple months whereas some flowering perennials can begin to fade within one to two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/product/pink-calibrachoa-yellow-bidens/\"><img width=\"878\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bloomscape_std-combo_pink-calibrachoa-yellow-bidens-white-lobelia-878x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-416655\" srcset=\"https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bloomscape_std-combo_pink-calibrachoa-yellow-bidens-white-lobelia-878x1024.jpg?ver=416655 878w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bloomscape_std-combo_pink-calibrachoa-yellow-bidens-white-lobelia-257x300.jpg?ver=416655 257w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bloomscape_std-combo_pink-calibrachoa-yellow-bidens-white-lobelia-768x896.jpg?ver=416655 768w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bloomscape_std-combo_pink-calibrachoa-yellow-bidens-white-lobelia-324x378.jpg?ver=416655 324w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bloomscape_std-combo_pink-calibrachoa-yellow-bidens-white-lobelia-1024x1195.jpg?ver=416655 1024w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bloomscape_std-combo_pink-calibrachoa-yellow-bidens-white-lobelia.jpg?ver=416655 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px\"></a></figure><h2>Our Take on Annuals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Annual plants provide the high-impact seasonal color that brings spring and summer gardens to life. They tend to grow quickly and produce dynamic, showy blooms that last well into late summer or even early fall. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While their life cycle only lasts one season, you can deadhead the flowers to prevent seed formation, which involves removing the spent or dead blooms from the plant. This practice essentially tricks the plant into increased flower production and creates blossoms well into fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, since annuals only stick around for one season, they allow you to experiment with color schemes and patterns each season without making any long-term commitments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while annuals die at the end of each growing season, you can collect the seeds at the end of the season and replant them come spring. Overall, Bloomscape recommends annuals for anyone, particularly for new gardeners, who are looking for long-lasting colorful plants to brighten any porch or patio.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Caring for Annuals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Always be sure to read the flower label carefully and plant your annuals in an ideal spot — some prefer 6–8 hours of full sun, while others prefer full shade. After planting your annuals in their new seasonal home, water deeply to help the roots take hold. Water consistently and more frequently during periods of drought. Be sure to fertilize regularly based on your plants’ specific needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Popular Annuals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our favorite annual flowers and foliage include <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/product/pink-impatiens/\">Impatiens</a>, <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/product/white-petunias/\">Petunias</a>, <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/product/yellow-begonias/\">Begonias</a>, <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/product/red-yellow-dahlias/\">Dahlias</a>, <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/product/red-geraniums/\">Geraniums</a>, <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/product/persian-shield/\">Persian Shield</a>, <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/product/helichrysum/\">Helichrysum</a>, and <a href=\"https://bloomscape.com/product/coleus/\">Coleus</a>. Other popular annuals are Chrysanthemums, Marigolds, Pansies, Ranunculuses, and Sunflowers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"853\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/albert-s-unsplash-853x1024.jpg?ver=420111\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-420111\" srcset=\"https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/albert-s-unsplash-853x1024.jpg?ver=420111 853w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/albert-s-unsplash-250x300.jpg?ver=420111 250w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/albert-s-unsplash-768x922.jpg?ver=420111 768w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/albert-s-unsplash-1280x1536.jpg?ver=420111 1280w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/albert-s-unsplash-1706x2048.jpg?ver=420111 1706w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/albert-s-unsplash-324x389.jpg?ver=420111 324w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/albert-s-unsplash-1024x1229.jpg?ver=420111 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px\"><figcaption><em>Courtesy of Unsplash</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Our Take on Perennials</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to their longer life cycle and seasonal hardiness, these lush plants often serve as the backbone of many outdoor gardens. Once established, they tend to require less water and day-to-day maintenance compared to blooming annuals. They’ll also last through winter and provide some semblance of a garden throughout these colder months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, patience is key when growing perennials. They may be a bit lackluster the first year or two as they take root, and will only flower for one season each year. Depending on your chosen species, perennials may require more seasonal upkeep since their foliage will stick around throughout the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Caring for Perennials</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For best results, these types of plants should be planted in spring or early fall. Be sure to select a perennial that’s well-suited to your climate so that it can survive winter, and heed the care instructions when selecting a gardening plot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Popular Perennials</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Common perennial flowers include Black-Eyed Susans, Daylilies, Salvias, Coneflowers, Lavender, and Peonies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Looking for More?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out our <a

This means that your Bloomscape potted plant arrives <em>healthy</em> and <em>thriving</em>.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most indoor plants you buy from a box store or other retailer spend 3–4 weeks getting from the greenhouse to your home. Buying houseplants online is not only easier, but it’s also better for the health of the plant. Consider this: Which plant has the best chance of thriving in your home? A stressed plant that hasn’t been properly cared for in at least a month, or a healthy, potted plant from Bloomscape that’s shipped to you straight from the plant experts at our greenhouse?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Houseplant’s Journey Home</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow along on a Bird of Paradise’s journey from our greenhouse to you, and learn more about how we care for your plant every step of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure><p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Bloomscape Way</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you buy a houseplant online from Bloomscape, it is shipped directly from our greenhouses near Grand Rapids, Michigan. The plant is cared for by plant experts and is kept in near perfect conditions, giving it the best start for its life in its new home with you. The plant is also raised in pots that promote healthy root development, have good drainage, and allows the plant to be watered thoroughly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you make your purchase, your indoor plant is carefully packaged in our innovative box that helps regulate the temperature, protects the plant from the bumps and knocks that occur during shipping, and prevents the pot from breaking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the plant arrives at your home, it is undamaged and healthy, and has only spent about a week in transit. In addition to the convenience, plants purchased from Bloomscape are living-room ready right out the box. They arrive potted with a saucer, meaning that once your unbox it, all you have to do is find the perfect spot for it in your home.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/supply-chain-info-graphic-updated-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Bloomscape best and easiest way to buy indoor plants\" class=\"wp-image-18385\" srcset=\"https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/supply-chain-info-graphic-updated-1024x1024.jpg?ver=18385 1024w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/supply-chain-info-graphic-updated-150x150.jpg?ver=18385 150w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/supply-chain-info-graphic-updated-300x300.jpg?ver=18385 300w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/supply-chain-info-graphic-updated-768x768.jpg?ver=18385 768w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/supply-chain-info-graphic-updated-324x324.jpg?ver=18385 324w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/supply-chain-info-graphic-updated-416x416.jpg?ver=18385 416w, https://bloomscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/supply-chain-info-graphic-updated-100x100.jpg?ver=18385 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure><h2>The Old Way</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, when you buy a plant from a box store or retailer, it probably spent 3-4 weeks (or more) getting from the greenhouse to your home. The young plants are raised in greenhouses in grower’s pots until they are big enough to be sold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now a little about grower’s pots. Grower’s pots were never intended to be used long-term and can cause some serious health issues for plants if they stay in them too long. Plants kept in grower’s pots are almost always root-bound, which inhibits their growth, makes it hard to water them properly, and makes them more susceptible to disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When they are ready, the plants (still in their grower’s pots) are boxed up and put on a truck headed to wholesalers across the country. These boxes do nothing to protect the plant from either damage from careless handling or temperature extremes. The plants are stored in wholesaler’s warehouses where they wait to be put on another truck to take them to the retail stores. They are kept in their boxes, not receiving the proper light, care, or water for a week or more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, the plants are put on another truck and shipped to retail stores. At the retailers, they again do not get the proper light, are exposed to drafts from opening doors and air conditioning and are taken care of by people who are not plant-experts. There the plant sits, in its grower’s pot, after its long journey, waiting for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you decide to buy the plant, but you still need to purchase a pot with drainage and a saucer (good luck though, most retailers don’t sell pots with drainage holes or saucers anymore), pick out the right soil, and re-pot it before you can put it in its new spot in your home.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bloomscape.com/green-living/best-way-buy-houseplants-online/\">The Easiest (And Best) Way to Buy Houseplants Online</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bloomscape.com/\">Bloomscape</a>.</p>\n",
